### Check whether a number is even or odd

**Concepts used:** conditionals

```py
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num % 2 == 0:
    print(num, "is even")
else:
    print(num, "is odd")
```
---

### Print even and odd series up to a given number
**Concepts used:** Loops, conditionals

```py
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print("Even numbers up to", num, ":")
for i in range(0, num + 1, 2):
    print(i, end=' ')
```
```py
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print("Odd numbers up to", num, ":")
for i in range(1, num + 1, 2):
    print(i, end=' ')
```
---

### Check whether a number is prime or not

**Concepts used:** Loops, conditionals, divisibility check

```py
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num > 1:
    for i in range(2, num):
        if num % i == 0:
            print(num, "is not a prime number")
            break
    else:
        print(num, "is a prime number")
else:
    print(num, "is not a prime number")
```

---

### Print prime numbers up to a given number
Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. For example, the first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.
**Concepts used:** Loops, conditionals, prime checking

```py
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print("Prime numbers up to", num, ":")
for n in range(2, num + 1):
    is_prime = True
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            is_prime = False
            break
    if is_prime:
        print(n, end=' ')
```
---

### Print Fibonacci series up to a given number
The **Fibonacci series** is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. For example, the series starts as 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.

**Concepts used:** Loops, conditionals
```py
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
a, b = 0, 1
print("Fibonacci series up to", num, ":")
print(a, end=' ')
print(b, end=' ')
while a <= num:
    c = a + b
    print(c, end=' ')
    a = b
    b = c
```

```py
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
a, b = 0, 1
print("Fibonacci series up to", num, ":")
print(a, end=' ')
print(b, end=' ')
while a <= num:
    print(a+b, end=' ')
    a, b = b, a + b
```

---
### Check whether a number is Palindrome or not
A **palindrome** is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. For example, 121 and 12321 are palindromes.
**Concepts used:** Loops, conditionals

```py
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
temp = num
reverse = 0
while temp > 0:
    digit = temp % 10
    reverse = reverse * 10 + digit
    temp //= 10

if num == reverse:
    print(num, "is a palindrome.")
else:
    print(num, "is not a palindrome.")
```

---
### Check whether a number is Armstrong or not
An **Armstrong number** (or narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).

**Concepts used:** Loops, conditionals

```py
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
sum = 0
temp = num

while temp > 0:
    digit = temp % 10
    sum += digit ** 3
    temp //= 10

if num == sum:
    print(num, "is an Armstrong number.")
else:
    print(num, "is not an Armstrong number.")
```
---
### Check whether a number is perfect or not
Perfect numbers are those that are equal to the sum of their proper divisors (excluding themselves). For example, 6, which has divisors 1, 2, and 3, and their sum is 6.

**Concepts used:** Loops, conditionals

```py
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
sum = 0

for i in range(1, num):
    if num % i == 0:
        sum += i

if sum == num:
    print(num, "is a perfect number.")
else:
    print(num, "is not a perfect number.")
```
---

### Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion

**Concepts used:** Recursion, input handling

```py
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print("Factorial of", num, "is", factorial(num))
```

---

### Count the number of vowels in a given string

**Concepts used:** Loops, conditionals, string manipulation

```py
text = input("Enter a string: ")
vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
count = 0

for char in text:
    if char in vowels:
        count += 1

print("Number of vowels:", count)
```

---

### Read a text file and count the number of words

**Concepts used:** File handling, string splitting

```py
filename = input("Enter file name: ")

try:
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
        words = content.split()
        print("Total number of words:", len(words))
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found.")
```

---

### Reverse a string and check if it's a palindrome

**Concepts used:** String slicing, conditionals

```py
text = input("Enter a string: ")
reversed_text = text[::-1]

if text == reversed_text:
    print("It's a palindrome.")
else:
    print("Not a palindrome.")
```
